A resume page that is structured in three containers:
- First container contains a image, a title and a description
- Second container contains a profile section, a skills section and a contact me section
- Third container contains a few links

Fonts used:
- Merriweather
- Sacramento
- Montserrat

## Story
I started by making an initial structure of the page,
I searched for the main image and the images for the skills,
and I imported the fonts. I added css and worked on the layout of the page,
as the main color I chose red and for the text a shade of gray. I made the button here at
